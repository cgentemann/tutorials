    "# nbdime - Notebook Diffing and Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "nbdime is a Python package for comparing the differences between two Notebooks. It can give you informative reports about changes at the command-line, and can also show a side-by-side comparison in the browser. When you have Notebooks in version control (e.g. git), it can also help you deal with resolving conflicting changes:\n",
    " - It uses the knowledge of the notebook format to make informed decisions about which changes are actually conflicting.\n",
    " - It ensures that conflicts can be presented in a workable Notebook (naive conflict resolution can often make the Notebook file  invalid).\n",
