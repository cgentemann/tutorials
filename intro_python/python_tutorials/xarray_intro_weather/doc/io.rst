Serialization and IO
====================

xray supports direct serialization and IO to several file formats. For more
options, consider exporting your objects to pandas (see the preceeding section)
and using its broad range of `IO tools`__.

__ http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import xray
    np.random.seed(123456)

Pickle
~~~~~~

The simplest way to serialize an xray object is to use Python's built-in pickle
module:

.. ipython:: python

    import cPickle as pickle

    ds = xray.Dataset({'foo': (('x', 'y'), np.random.rand(4, 5))},
                      coords={'x': [10, 20, 30, 40],
                              'y': pd.date_range('2000-01-01', periods=5),
                              'z': ('x', list('abcd'))})

    # use the highest protocol (-1) because it is way faster than the default
    # text based pickle format
    pkl = pickle.dumps(ds, protocol=-1)

    pickle.loads(pkl)

Pickle support is important because it doesn't require any external libraries
and lets you use xray objects with Python modules like
:py:mod:`multiprocessing`. However, there are two important cavaets:

1. To simplify serialization, xray's support for pickle currently loads all
   array values into memory before dumping an object. This means it is not
   suitable for serializing datasets too big to load into memory (e.g., from
   netCDF or OPeNDAP).
2. Pickle will only work as long as the internal data structure of xray objects
   remains unchanged. Because the internal design of xray is still being
   refined, we make no guarantees (at this point) that objects pickled with
   this version of xray will work in future versions.

netCDF
~~~~~~

Currently, the only disk based serialization format that xray directly supports
is `netCDF`__. netCDF is a file format for fully self-described datasets that
is widely used in the geosciences and supported on almost all platforms. We use
netCDF because xray was based on the netCDF data model, so netCDF files on disk
directly correspond to :py:class:`~xray.Dataset` objects. Recent versions
netCDF are based on the even more widely used HDF5 file-format.

__ http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/

Reading and writing netCDF files with xray requires the
`Python-netCDF4`__ library.

__ https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python

We can save a Dataset to disk using the
:py:attr:`Dataset.to_netcdf <xray.Dataset.to_netcdf>` method:

.. use verbatim because readthedocs doesn't have netCDF4 support

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [1]: ds.to_netcdf('saved_on_disk.nc')

By default, the file is saved as netCDF4.

We can load netCDF files to create a new Dataset using the
:py:func:`~xray.open_dataset` function:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [1]: ds_disk = xray.open_dataset('saved_on_disk.nc')

    In [2]: ds_disk
    Out[2]:
    <xray.Dataset>
    Dimensions:  (x: 4, y: 5)
    Index Coordinates:
        x        (x) int64 10 20 30 40
        y        (y) datetime64[ns] 2000-01-01 2000-01-02 2000-01-03 2000-01-04 2000-01-05
    Variables:
        foo      (x, y) float64 0.127 0.9667 0.2605 0.8972 0.3767 0.3362 0.4514 0.8403 0.1231 ...
        z        (x) |S1 'a' 'b' 'c' 'd'

A dataset can also be loaded from a specific group within a netCDF
file. To load from a group, pass a ``group`` keyword argument to the
``open_dataset`` function. The group can be specified as a path-like
string, e.g., to access subgroup 'bar' within group 'foo' pass
'/foo/bar' as the ``group`` argument.

Data is loaded lazily from netCDF files. You can manipulate, slice and subset
Dataset and DataArray objects, and no array values are loaded into memory until
necessary. For an example of how these lazy arrays work, see the OPeNDAP
section below.

.. tip::

    xray's lazy loading of remote or on-disk datasets is often but not always
    desirable. Before performing computationally intense operations, it is
    usually a good idea to load a dataset entirely into memory by using the
    :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.load_data` method:

    .. ipython::
        :verbatim:

        In [1]: ds_disk.load_data()

Datasets have a :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.close` method to close the associated
netCDF file. However, it's often cleaner to use a ``with`` statement:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    # this automatically closes the dataset after use
    In [100]: with xray.open_dataset('saved_on_disk.nc') as ds:
    ...           print(ds.keys())
    Out[100]: [u'foo', u'y', u'x', u'z']

.. note::

    Although xray provides reasonable support for incremental reads of files on
    disk, it does not yet support incremental writes, which is important for
    dealing with datasets that do not fit into memory. This is a significant
    shortcoming that we hope to resolve (:issue:`199`) by adding the ability to
    create ``Dataset`` objects directly linked to a netCDF file on disk.

NetCDF files follow some conventions for encoding datetime arrays (as numbers
with a "units" attribute) and for packing and unpacking data (as
described by the "scale_factor" and "_FillValue" attributes). If the argument
``decode_cf=True`` (default) is given to ``open_dataset``, xray will attempt
to automatically decode the values in the netCDF objects according to
`CF conventions`_. Sometimes this will fail, for example, if a variable
has an invalid "units" or "calendar" attribute. For these cases, you can
turn this decoding off manually.

.. _CF conventions: http://cfconventions.org/

You can view this encoding information and control the details of how xray
serializes objects, by viewing and manipulating the
:py:attr:`DataArray.encoding <xray.DataArray.encoding>` attribute:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [1]: ds_disk['y'].encoding
    Out[1]:
    {'calendar': u'proleptic_gregorian',
     'chunksizes': None,
     'complevel': 0,
     'contiguous': True,
     'dtype': dtype('float64'),
     'fletcher32': False,
     'least_significant_digit': None,
     'shuffle': False,
     'source': 'saved_on_disk.nc',
     'units': u'days since 2000-01-01 00:00:00',
     'zlib': False}

OPeNDAP
~~~~~~~

xray includes support for `OPeNDAP`__ (via the netCDF4 library or Pydap), which
lets us access large datasets over HTTP.

__ http://www.opendap.org/

For example, we can open a connetion to GBs of weather data produced by the
`PRISM`__ project, and hosted by
`International Research Institute for Climate and Society`__ at Columbia:

__ http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/
__ http://iri.columbia.edu/

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [3]: remote_data = xray.open_dataset(
       ...:     'http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.OSU/.PRISM/.monthly/dods',
       ...:     decode_times=False)

    In [4]: remote_data
    Out[4]:
    <xray.Dataset>

    Attributes:
        Conventions: IRIDL
        expires: 1375315200

.. note::

    Like many real-world datasets, this dataset does not entirely follow
    `CF conventions`_. Unexpected formats will usually cause xray's automatic
    decoding to fail. The way to work around this is to either set
    ``decode_cf=False`` in ``open_dataset`` to turn off all use of CF
    conventions, or by only disabling the troublesome parser.
    In this case, we set ``decode_times=False`` because the time axis here
    provides the calendar attribute in a format that xray does not expect
    (the integer ``360`` instead of a string like ``'360_day'``).


We can select and slice this data any number of times, and nothing is loaded
over the network until we look at particular values:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [4]: tmax = remote_data['tmax'][:500, ::3, ::3]

    In [5]: tmax
    Out[5]:
    <xray.DataArray 'tmax' (T: 500, Y: 207, X: 469)>
    [48541500 values with dtype=float64]
    Coordinates:
      * Y        (Y) float32 49.9167 49.7917 49.6667 49.5417 49.4167 49.2917 49.1667 ...
      * X        (X) float32 -125.0 -124.875 -124.75 -124.625 -124.5 -124.375 -124.25 ...
      * T        (T) float32 -779.5 -778.5 -777.5 -776.5 -775.5 -774.5 -773.5 -772.5 -771.5 ...

        standard_name: air_temperature
        units: Celsius_scale
        expires: 1375315200

Finally, let's plot a small subset with matplotlib:

.. ipython::
    :verbatim:

    In [6]: tmax_ss = tmax[0]

    In [8]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    In [10]: plt.figure(figsize=(9, 5))

    In [11]: plt.gca().patch.set_color('0')

    In [12]: plt.contourf(tmax_ss['X'], tmax_ss['Y'], tmax_ss.values, 20,
       ....:     cmap='RdBu_r')

    In [113]: plt.colorbar(label='tmax (deg C)')

.. image:: _static/opendap-prism-tmax.png

.. note::

    We do hope to eventually add plotting methods to xray to make this easier
    (:issue:`185`).
